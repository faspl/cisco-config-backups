Cisco switch config file backup script
======================================

This script allows network backups of Cisco switches. It stores the configs
in subversion repositories. The diff between the previous and current configs
is output on stdout, so if run from cron will e-mail the config changes.

Config files in etc/ define the switches to backup. A "group" of switches
defines the directory that those switch configs are put in. Each group has a
separate subversion repository, created automatically by the script.
