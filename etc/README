# README for switch backup config

# All files in this directory are treated as config files (so this
# readme needs to have all lines commented out, which is as usual
# with lines commencing with a hash)

# lines are fields:
#
#   name  ip  community  group
#
# where "name" and "ip" are mandatory

# defaults can be set with
#
# %community public
# %group groupname
# %interface eth0
#
# and are used from that point onwards in the config file

# (interface is used to find the IP address that the switch is
# told to write the config file back to)
